# Movable Pendulum Simulation (Pygame + Pymunk)

This project demonstrates a simple **2D pendulum physics simulation** built using **Pygame** and **Pymunk**, designed with clean **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** principles.

The pendulum naturally swings under gravity — and you can **click and drag the bob with your mouse** to set it in motion.

## 🚀 Features

- Uses **Pygame** for window & graphics.
- Uses **Pymunk** for real-time 2D physics.
- Fully object-oriented: `Pendulum` and `Game` classes.
- Interactive: **click and drag the bob** to move it.
- Realistic physics behavior with gravity and constraints.
